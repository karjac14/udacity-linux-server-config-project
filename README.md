# udacity-linux-server-config-project
a project for a Udacity Full Stack Web Developement Nanodegree 


## Intro

This is a demonstration of deploying simple Flask-based web application on AWS Lightsail - Unubtu OS.  
  

## Configurations

The following configuations are needed for the grader:

IP: 18.216.180.137  
SSH port: 2200  
URL: http://www.18.216.180.137.xip.io/  

## Summary

One major new thing I did here, that I recently learned, is setting up a virtual environment that keeps the python application and its dependencies isolated from the main system. It keeps the dependencies easy to maintain and located. A `pip` package called `virtualenv` has been installed.
